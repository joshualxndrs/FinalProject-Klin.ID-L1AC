                        <p>
                            Excessive plastic consumption and poor waste management has been a problem that has been around for too long and has created a major impact in our country and the world. From over plastic consumption, poor material choice for manufacturing, and also irresponsible
                            consumption has created an everlasting problem that we have to deal with everyday and feel the biggest impact in the future. Indonesia has taken part in this problem by having 6.8 million tons of plastic waste a year and only
                            10% that end up in recycling centers. The rest of it will mostly end in the ocean and threaten our wild lives both in sea and land.

                        <p>
                            According to the World bank, Indonesia still has around 40% of the country that doesn't have access to waste collection service. Therefore we decided to help people that need this service and also deliver the waste to a responsible waste collector and
                            work with sustainability companies and create products that can give back to the community and encourage people more into this lifestyle.
